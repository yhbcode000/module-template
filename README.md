## 🏗️ Structure Overview

The repository follows a modular structure to ensure separation of concerns, ease of testing, and code maintainability. The directory layout is as follows:

```plaintext
module-template/
├── src/
│   ├── control/            # Contains controllers for handling business logic
│   ├── dao/                # Data Access Objects for interacting with databases or storage
│   ├── model/              # Data models representing entities and structures
│   ├── utils/              # Utility functions for common tasks
│   └── view/               # Views for rendering outputs (e.g., APIs or CLI)
├── storage/
│   ├── config/             # Configuration files
│   │   └── main_config.yaml  # Main configuration file
│   └── log/                # Log files
│       └── .gitkeep        # Keeps log directory in version control
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py         # Initializer for the tests package
│   └── ...                 # Test modules for various components
├── .gitignore              # Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control
├── LICENSE                 # License file
├── main.py                 # Entry point for running the module
├── README.md               # Project description and instructions
└── setup.py                # Setup script for packaging and distribution
```

## ✨ Features

- **Standardized Structure**: Provides a consistent starting point for new Python projects.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divides the project into distinct layers (control, dao, model, utils, view) to promote modularity and maintainability.
- **Predefined Configuration**: Uses a YAML configuration file to easily manage settings and parameters.
- **Ready-to-Use Template**: Includes necessary files for immediate use, including a `setup.py` script for packaging.

## ⚙️ Installation

To create a new project using this template:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/module-template.git
   cd module-template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

To start using the module, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize the `main.py` file as needed to serve as the entry point for your specific project.

## 🔧 Configuration

The template uses a YAML configuration file located at `storage/config/main_config.yaml`. You can modify this file to set parameters such as logging levels, API keys, and other settings.

Example configuration:

```yaml
logging:
  level: "INFO"
database:
  uri: "sqlite:///example.db"
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the test suite, use:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This command will execute all the test cases in the `tests` directory and provide a report of the test results.
